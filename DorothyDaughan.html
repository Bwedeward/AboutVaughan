        Dorothy Johnson Vaughan (September 20, 1910 â€“ November 10, 2008) was an
        African American mathematician and human computer who worked for the
        National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and NASA, at Langley
        Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. In 1949, she became acting
        supervisor of the West Area Computers, the first African-American woman
        to supervise a staff at the center.

      Dorothy Vaughan was an important contributor to the early U.S. space
      program.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)</li>
      <li>
        Promoted to lead the West Area Computing Unit ("West Computers") in
        1949, despite NACA being segregated and black employees having to use
        separate facilities
        <ul>
          <li>
            The West Computers was a group of black female mathematicians
            considered "human computers" who performed complex computations and
            analyzed data for aerospace engineers
          </li>
          <li>
            Through this promotion, Vaughan became the first black supervisor
            and one of the few female supervisors within NACA
          </li>
          <li>
            Vaughan supervised the West Computers until 1958 when NACA was
            incorporated into the newly created NASA and the segregated
            facilities were closed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Joined the NASA Analysis and Computation Division, a group of men and
        women of all races, with many other West Computers
      </li>
      <li>
        Became an expert at FORTRAN, a computer programming language used for
        scientific and algebraic applications, as NASA had begun using
        electronic computers
